# Task Scheduling Program

An application built using Java language and Swing library to visualize the most common scheduling algorithms.

# Available Algorithms
* First Come First Served (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
* Round Robin (RR)
* Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

# Input
The application input is an excel file containing the Process name, Arrival time, Burst time and deadline.

# Output
Each algorithm generate a 'Queue of Processes' indicating the order of running, and can be exported to an excel file.

> This code is still in progress, more algorithms may be added in the future
